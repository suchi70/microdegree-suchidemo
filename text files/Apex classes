Apex classes in Salesforce are blueprints for creating objects, 
containing variables (state) and methods (behavior) written in 
the Apex programming language. They are used to encapsulate and 
reuse functionality, control application logic, and interact with 
Salesforce data, similar to how classes are used in Java or C#.
